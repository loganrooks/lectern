"""Structural pins for the automation package's layering.

These assert boundaries rather than behavior. They exist because the costs the
layering buys — a state store that carries no transport, an import surface
consumers can rely on, and an ingest pipeline that sits above the store rather
than inside it — are all invisible to a behavioral suite, and so are exactly the
kind of property a later change can dissolve without any test noticing.
