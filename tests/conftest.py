"""Default-deny network access for the unit suite.

Lectern's privacy posture says unit tests do not touch the network. Until now
that was enforced by two tests that patched `socket.socket` for their own
duration -- which proves those two paths are clean and says nothing about the
rest of the suite. A guarantee that holds only where someone remembered to
assert it is a guarantee about the assertions, not about the program.

So the block is applied to every test automatically, and the `integration`
marker is the only way out. `pyproject.toml` already deselects that marker from
`make verify`, so the default path is both network-free and enforced rather than
network-free and hoped for.

The block is a fixture rather than an import-time patch on purpose: patching at
collection would also cover module imports, where a library opening a socket
would fail the run in a way that has nothing to do with what any test does.
