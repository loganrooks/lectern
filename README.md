**Turn talks into thought.** Lectern ingests recorded talks and produces local,
inspectable knowledge bundles for humans and agents.

Lectern is pre-release software. The current public preview surface is a
CLI-first local workflow: ingest local media, record provenance in a bundle, and
inspect the local source, queue, and library state. There is no package-registry
release yet.

## Quickstart

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12 or newer
- `uv`
- `ffmpeg`

Check that Lectern can be installed from the public repository:

```bash
uv tool run --from git+https://github.com/loganrooks/lectern.git lectern --version
```

Run the local fixture workflow from a checkout:

```bash
set -e
LECTERN_TMP="$(mktemp -d)"
git clone https://github.com/loganrooks/lectern.git "$LECTERN_TMP/lectern"
cd "$LECTERN_TMP/lectern"
make sync
uv run lectern doctor
uv run lectern ingest tests/fixtures/synthetic_talk.wav --output "$LECTERN_TMP/bundles" --state "$LECTERN_TMP/state.sqlite"
uv run lectern library list --state "$LECTERN_TMP/state.sqlite"
```

The fixture uses synthetic audio and a committed transcript sidecar so the
workflow is redistributable and does not download an ASR model.

## Design Shape

- Pipeline of pure stages: acquire, normalize, transcribe, diarize, visual,
  enrich, situate, synthesize.
- Durable bundle artifacts on disk, with explicit manifests and stage records.
- Local-first media processing with per-stage opt-in for remote APIs.
- Synthetic fixtures only; no copyrighted media fixtures in the repository.

## Development

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12 or newer
- `uv`
- `ffmpeg` for media work beyond the scaffold

```bash
make sync
make verify
```

`make verify` is the local and CI verification entrypoint. It runs linting,
format checks, type checks, tests, and the public repository safety check.

## Current Preview Support

The current `lectern ingest` path supports the synthetic fixture workflow:

```bash
uv run lectern ingest tests/fixtures/synthetic_talk.wav
```

That fixture uses a committed `.transcript.txt` sidecar so CI can check bundle
behavior and transcript passthrough without downloading ASR models or sending
media to remote services.

Lectern can also use an optional local JSON transcriber command for media
without a sidecar:

```bash
uv run lectern ingest local-talk.wav --transcriber-command "my-local-asr --json {input}"
```

The command is executed locally with the normalized audio path and must emit JSON
segments or text. Lectern records transcript method metadata and timestamp
anchors, but it does not bundle an ASR model, does not call remote transcription
providers, and does not claim transcript faithfulness. A user-supplied command
runs with the user's privileges; Lectern cannot prove that command never opens a
network connection.

Before planning or processing, Lectern captures a private temporary media copy
and the sidecar bytes, if present. Queued ingest checks those captured inputs
against the existing approval before normalization or transcription; planning,
replay selection, and processing use the same capture. Approval still covers a
present sidecar when an explicit command supplies the transcript instead.
This binds the input Lectern supplies, not the behavior or faithfulness of an
arbitrary user command. It does not authenticate previously generated bundles.

Lectern also has an early local automation spine for folder sources. It records
source and queue state in local SQLite, scans local folders without network
access, requires explicit queue approval before ingesting a discovered item, and
indexes completed bundles:

```bash
uv run lectern sources add-folder talks ~/Talks
uv run lectern sources scan talks
uv run lectern queue list
uv run lectern queue approve <queue-item-id>
uv run lectern queue ingest <queue-item-id>
uv run lectern library list
```

Plain `library list` and `library show <bundle-id>` rows contain three tab-separated
fields: bundle ID, creation time, and status (`ready`, `incomplete`, `failed`, or
`needs-reprocessing`).

Use `--json` on source, queue, and library commands for machine-readable output.
The state database is local run state under `.lectern/` by default and should not
be committed.

Lectern can also discover public YouTube playlist metadata through the YouTube
Data API. This is metadata-only discovery: it records playlist/video metadata in
the local source registry and review queue, but it does not download YouTube
media, captions, or transcripts and cannot yet ingest a YouTube queue item into
a bundle.

```bash
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY=...
uv run lectern sources preflight-youtube "PL..."
uv run lectern sources add-youtube-playlist lectures "PL..."
uv run lectern sources scan lectures
uv run lectern sources scan lectures --max-pages 2
uv run lectern queue list --json
```

The API key is read from the environment and is not stored in Lectern state or
bundle artifacts. Each playlist page request consumes an estimated 1 YouTube
Data API quota unit; scan JSON reports estimated units consumed for the scan.
`--max-pages N` caps how many playlist pages one scan requests. A capped scan is
a partial view of the playlist, so it records new and changed items but skips
removals entirely and reports `removals_skipped_due_to_truncation` in the scan
metadata. `--max-pages` and `--api-key-env` apply to YouTube playlist sources
only; passing either to a local-folder scan is rejected with exit code 2.

A playlist entry is identified by its video ID, not by its playlist-item ID, so
the same video listed twice in one playlist is recorded once, and reordering a
playlist or re-adding a video under a new playlist-item ID does not create a
second entry for it. Playlist-item IDs, playlist positions, and insertion
timestamps are recorded as metadata but do not count as content changes, so a
remove-and-re-add is not re-queued for review.
Private and deleted playlist placeholders are recorded as source items flagged
`video.placeholder` and are never added to the review queue.

A YouTube queue item cannot be ingested into a bundle. Attempting it records the
item in the terminal `unsupported` state with an explanatory error, and
`queue retry` / `queue approve` on such an item are refused rather than looping
through a failure that can never succeed. Use `queue list --queue-state
unsupported` to inspect them.

## Search and citations

`lectern library search QUERY --state PATH` searches transcript segments and is
literal by default; pass `--operators` only when you intentionally want SQLite
FTS operators. When literal query text contains option-like tokens such as
`--json`, put a standalone `--` before the query.
`lectern library cite BUNDLE_ID SEGMENT_ID --state PATH` returns
an anchor tied to the cited transcript content. An `exact` resolution means the
segment ID and content digest agree; it does not establish that the timestamp is
within the recording or playable. The separate anchor-correctness sampler checks
temporal bounds and ordering. Displayed timestamps truncate to whole seconds
and retain a negative sign when the recorded time is negative.

Search tokenization separates words on whitespace and punctuation for Latin,
Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, and Hebrew, including right-to-left text. Literal search
uses bounded character segmentation for the listed Han, kana, Hangul and Bopomofo
ranges: CJK unified/compatibility ideographs and their supported extensions;
Hiragana, Katakana, half-width Katakana, Katakana Phonetic Extensions, Kana
Supplement, Kana Extended-A/B and Small Kana Extension; Hangul syllables and
Jamo ranges; and Bopomofo and Bopomofo Extended. This is not exhaustive support
for every language, orthography or Unicode script. Two-character terms can match
inside longer runs, with substring false positives and no word-boundary accuracy;
stemming is not provided. Operator-mode queries refuse these character ranges;
use literal search for them. Later search work may add ranking or semantic
retrieval; the current literal search and citation commands are available now.

The [recorded M5a latency datum](docs/benchmarks/m5a-search-latency.json)
captures one synthetic 1,000-bundle measurement and its conditions; it is not
a performance guarantee. The state store currently reconciles registered
transcript files on each command open to keep search results aligned with
changed or missing bundle content. The datum keeps separately labeled historical open/reconcile measurements
alongside the current SQLite query-only timing; the open-path measurements were
not rerun for the current segmenter version.

## Current Limits

- YouTube support is limited to public-playlist metadata discovery through an
  API key. OAuth/private playlist access is not implemented.
- Lectern does not download media, captions, or transcripts from external
  services.
- MCP/API access, ranked or semantic search, visual evidence, OCR, reference resolution, and
  citation-gated synthesis are later roadmap items.
- The local command transcriber path is an integration point, not a bundled ASR
  engine or transcript-quality guarantee.
- Local bundles can contain sensitive media-derived artifacts. Keep them out of
  commits and issue reports.
- Bundle manifest compatibility is tied to the manifest `schema_version`. The
  current manifest schema version is `1.0.0`; pre-release compatibility policy
  is described in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).
